Running the Program:

In order to run our graphical automata tool, download the most recent AutomataGuiBuild, or the most recent AutomataGui. AutomataGuiBuild is the pre-built version that does not require Visual Studio to run, AutomataGui is the solution file that can be ran and edited inside of visual studio.

To run the Built version, download and extract the file. Click on the exe file to install the tool. All functions are handled by the menu bar along the top of the form.

To run the Visual Studio version, download and extract the solution. Open it in Visual Studio and use the run program function in the editor to run the program.

Please note that the Visual Studio version contains three sample automata files named a, b, and c which can be automatically loaded into the GUI to produce a quick visual of the tools functionality.
